# Briefing:

For this exercise you will use the .http method of retrieving information from existing APIs and write a little bit about the response you got from your request. You will write 2 to 3 sentences on the response received which, depending on the status code and content, will be different between each part of this assignment's response. This is explained in more detail in the files within the 8 folder for this module. There is a VSCode extension that is required for the .http requests to work, which is mentioned in the Lesson 8-1: REST materials. However, here is the download link for your convenience: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client.
